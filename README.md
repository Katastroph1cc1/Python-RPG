# Python-RPG
Created a text based RPG in Python similar to that of the old school LORD game.
It is a game with 3 classes to choose from. Mage, Warrior, Rogue. You can do quests to level up to level 10
You level up by starting in the central located city and can pick up quests and buy potions for your inventory as well
As you level you will learn skills
There are random events that can happen while exploring
At Level 10 the "Final Boss" will be available for you to go fight and kill
